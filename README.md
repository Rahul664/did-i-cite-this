Collaborating on a paper and end up citing the same source twice with different keys?  
Caught duplicate references just before submission? Been there.

## 💡 **Did I Cite This?**

**Did I Cite This?** is a simple, drag-and-drop utility that scans your `.bib` file, detects duplicates by title, and saves you time and hassle during proofreading.

No setup. No stress. Just clean citations. ✅

### 📂 How It Works

1. **Drag and drop** your `.bib` file into the checker  
2. It scans all entries and compares them by **title**
3. If duplicates exist, they’ll be listed for you to review
4. If not — 🎉 you’re good to go!

## 🧪 Why I Built This

As a research student, I’ve been caught in the chaos of BibTeX mess-ups more times than I’d like to admit — especially when working in collaborations. 

This tool exists to make sure **you don’t have to go through that manually**.
