## ❓ Tired of Duplicate BibTeX Entries?

Ever worked on a paper with multiple co-authors and found yourself wondering:
- *"Wait… didn’t we already cite this paper?"*
- *"Why are there two different keys for the same reference?"*
- *"Why do we only notice duplicates the night before submission?"* 😫

If you’ve been there — **I have too**. More than once.

## 💡 Introducing: **Did I Cite This?**

This simple, no-fuss tool helps you:
- ✅ Quickly check your `.bib` file for **duplicate citations**
- 🔍 Find entries that look the same but have different keys
- ⏱️ Save time on manual checks during proofreading
- 🤝 Avoid last-minute chaos when collaborating with co-authors

---

### 📂 How It Works

1. **Drag and drop** your `.bib` file into the checker  
2. It scans all entries and compares them by **title**
3. If duplicates exist, they’ll be listed for you to review
4. If not — 🎉 you’re good to go!

## 🧪 Why I Built This

As a research student, I’ve been caught in the chaos of BibTeX mess-ups more times than I’d like to admit — especially when working in large collaborations. This tool exists to make sure **you don’t have to go through that**.
